    <h1>Slow cooker buffalo chicken sandwiches</h1>
    <p>This crockpot Buffalo chicken is great for hearty sandwiches that will please those who love Buffalo chicken wings.
    <br>This recipe is perfect for those days spent watching football. I like to top these with blue cheese or ranch dressing.</p>
